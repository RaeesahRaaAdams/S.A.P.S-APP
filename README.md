# S.A.P.S-APP
Police App
#My idea of the S.A.P.S-APP is to insure that minor and major criminally inclined activities are 100% responsive and immediate ly dealt with.
The app will include all featuresh that of which immediate access and assistance is provided.
Such as;
Profile (Forename,Name,Contact details,ID,Address)
Emergency services,
J88+Medical Assistance on site
Rape Reports,
Affidavit Reports,
Police Van Requests,
Domestic violence,
GBV,
Theft,
Filing Cases/Case Number,
Restraining orders,
Fire brigade +Ambulance
Death report,
Information box,
Missing Reports
Drug Related Reports
Careers

More features will be updated as the app grows.
The S.A.P.S play one of the largest roles in society. Technology grows everyday, merging Technology with S.A.P.S will be convenient, being able to reach out and address a complaint or other features mentioned above at the tip of your fingers before wasting time and money going directly to the Police department and being sent back for documents, or court retrieve a case number etc.
Personally pressing charges and writing out case reports are time consuming and most Departments are short of staff and often tend to send plaintiffs back to go back to the department.
As the economy is still struggling, spending money on transportation and other expenses toward criminally inclined activities usually increases the risk of law being taken into the hands of the plaintiff.
To avoid confusion and missing requirements, rather speak to an officer via the chat box prior to transporting to the department.
